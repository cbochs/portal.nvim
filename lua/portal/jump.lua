--- Populate an ordered list of available jumps based on an input list of
--- queries.
---
--- In order to generate unique jumps, an individual jump may only be
--- associated with a unique query _predicate_ once. However, a jump may be
--- associated with more than one query.
---
--- Example:
---
--- Given an list of jump queries: `{ "valid", "valid", "modified" }`,
--- the resulting ordered list will be:
--- * the first jump will be associated with the first item in the jumplist
--- * the second jump will be associated with the second item in the jumplist
--- * if the first jump was also modified, the third jump will also be
---   associated with the first item in the jumplist
